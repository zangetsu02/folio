You weren’t made to stay where nothing changes.  
Purpose begins where comfort ends. <br>

::section-item{:number='1' title="Works"}
I work at the intersection of frontend clarity and backend structure.  
At [**Links**](https://www.linksmt.it), I build web applications that balance usability, scalability, and long-term maintainability, often in complex domains such as public administration and funding systems.
If you want more information about my work, you can che out my [**resume**](/cv){.link}.
<br>
<br>
Beyond client work, I contribute to open-source projects like [**Nuxt UI**](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started) and [**UI Pro**](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro), and I lead the development of :icon{name="custom:shelve"} [***Shelve***](https://shelve.cloud){.link}, a modern workspace for collaborative development.  
<br><br>

::section-item{:number='2' title="Writing"}
I believe good ideas deserve clarity, not noise.  
Through writing, I try to make sense of what I learn: patterns, mental models, architecture, the invisible logic behind a clean interface or a reliable service.  

My writing is not about trends, but about understanding and structure.
