::section-item{:number='1' title="Works"}
I develop web applications that pair a clear, user-focused frontend with a robust, well-structured backend,
delivering solutions that stay usable, scalable, and maintainable over time, even in complex settings.

If you want more information about my work, you can che out my [**resume**](/cv){.link}.

::section-item{:number='2' title="Writing"}
I believe good ideas deserve clarity, not noise.
Through writing, I try to make sense of what I learn: patterns, mental models, architecture, the invisible logic behind a clean interface or a reliable service.

My writing is not about trends, but about understanding and structure.
