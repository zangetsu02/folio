#about
Move slow and break everything.

**Software engineer** based in Rome, Italy, with **3+ years of crafting digital experiences**. Curiosity powered back in the day, and it still drives
me to craft solutions that push boundaries while staying _clean and intuitive_.

Currently using at work :icon{align name="simple-icons:spring" .size-4 size="20px"} **Java/Spring** and :icon{align name="simple-icons:angular" .size-4 size="20px"} **Angular**,
in love with the :icon{align name="simple-icons:vuedotjs" .size-4 size="20px"} **Vue** / :icon{align name="simple-icons:nuxt" .size-4 size="20px"} **Nuxt** ecosystem,
now learning :icon{align name="simple-icons:rust" .size-4 size="20px"} **Rust** in my free time.

The discovery of these technologies showed me that **true innovation isn't about adding more** â€” it's about **making the complex feel natural**. This
revelation pushed me to **embrace open-source development**, sharing my work with the community and learning from
every contribution and interaction.
_**sometimes the most elegant solution requires looking at problems from a different angle**_.

The tech world often
races toward complexity. I prefer to **step back and ask "why?" before asking "how?"** It's this mindset that
transformed my understanding of development. I've learned
that the most powerful solutions are often the most thoughtfully simplified ones.
